# 3-DOF-Robotic-Arm

- Build a 3-DOF Robotic Arm using 3D printed parts and servo motors.
- Programmed control logic in Arduino / C++.
- Integrated an Ultrasonic sensor to detect object proximity.


## Mechanical Design

The robotic arm is based on open-source 3D models, adapted and modified by me for:
- improved fit and assembly,
- and an added ultrasonic sensor mount.
