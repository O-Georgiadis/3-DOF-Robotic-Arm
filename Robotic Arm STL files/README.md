# STL Files – Robotic Arm

The base STL files used for this robotic arm were created by:

- **Author:** RACBOTS  
- **Source:** https://www.printables.com/@RACBOTS_756978

I used these files as a starting point and modified some parts to:
- improve mechanical fit.
- design and add a custom mount for an ultrasonic distance sensor.
